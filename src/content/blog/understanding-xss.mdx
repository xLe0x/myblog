# Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) remains one of the most prevalent web security vulnerabilities. In this post, we'll explore different types of XSS attacks and how to prevent them.

## Types of XSS

### Reflected XSS
Reflected XSS occurs when malicious scripts are injected into websites through URL parameters or form inputs that are immediately reflected back to the user.

### Stored XSS
Stored XSS happens when malicious scripts are permanently stored on target servers and later displayed to other users.

### DOM-based XSS
DOM-based XSS occurs when JavaScript modifies the DOM in an unsafe way, allowing attackers to inject malicious content.

## Prevention Techniques

1. Input Validation
2. Output Encoding
3. Content Security Policy (CSP)
4. HttpOnly Cookies

```javascript
// Example of unsafe DOM manipulation
element.innerHTML = userInput; // Bad!

// Safe alternative
element.textContent = userInput; // Good!
```

# Active Directory Penetration Testing Journey

As a junior penetration tester and CS student, I've been focusing on mastering Active Directory security. Here's my learning journey and key insights.

## Getting Started

My journey into AD pentesting began with understanding the basics:
- Domain Controllers
- Users and Groups
- Group Policies
- Authentication Mechanisms

## Key Learning Areas

### 1. Initial Access
- LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
- SMB Relay Attacks
- Password Spraying

### 2. Enumeration
- BloodHound
- PowerView
- ADExplorer

### 3. Privilege Escalation
- Kerberoasting
- AS-REP Roasting
- ACL Abuse

## Tools of the Trade

```powershell
# Example PowerView enumeration
Get-NetDomain
Get-NetUser
Get-NetGroup
```
